* Opamp buffers for Hall inputs -> check
* Finish buck converter -> check 
* Change gate drivers to LF2190NTR -> check
* Change trough hole resistors to smd -> check
* Change 10V charge pump to regulator
* Voltage sense now lower voltage and diodes no longer necessary since no cap switching
* Hall sensors could be DRV5055A3ELPGMQ1 https://www.digikey.nl/short/mpwrm95b 
* Connectors rather than pads -> ceck
* mounting holes
* check if inputs pen 1-4 can be used as digital inputs
